## Challenges

#### A. Hello, world!

_console, editor, github, functions, if/then_

1. Write a function called `hello` that prints "Hello, world!" in the console.
1. Write a function that takes a name and prints "Hello, " followed by the name:
1. Write a function that takes two names and says hello to both of them:
1. Write a function that takes one or two names. If two names are provided, say hello to both of them. Otherwise, say hello to just one.

#### B. Functions with numbers

_arrays, loops, functions calling functions_

1. Write a function that takes two numbers `a` and `b` and multiplies them together.
1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and adds them all up.
1. Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the average.
1. Write a function that takes a todo list in the form of an array, and prints them all to the console.

#### C. Even/odd

_modulo, array methods_

1. Write a function named `isEven` that takes a number and returns `true` if it is even, `false` if it is odd.
1. Write a function `isOdd` that takes a number and returns `true` if the number is odd, `false` if it is even. Use the `isEven` function inside `isOdd`.
1. Write a function named `allAreEven` that takes an array of numbers and returns `true` if **all** the numbers in the array are even.
1. Write a function named `someAreEven` that takes an array of numbers and returns true if **at least one** of the numbers in the array are even.
1. Write a function named `evenPercentage` that takes an array of numbers and returns the percentage of numbers in the array that are even.

#### D. Divisibility

_refactoring; objects_

1. Write a function that tells if a number is divisible by 3.
1. Write a function that tells if a number is divisible by 5.
1. Write a function that takes two numbers, `n` and `d`, and tells if `n` is divisible by `d`.
1. Refactor `isDivisibleBy3` and `isDivisibleBy5` so that they use the general `isDivisible` function internally.
1. Write a function that tells if a number is prime, using the sieve of Eratosthenes.

#### E. Simple game

"Guess my number" game

## F. Final project

"Concentration" game
